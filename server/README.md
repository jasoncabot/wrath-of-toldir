# Wrath of Toldir

A very simple MMORPG with the aim of learning more about Cloudflare's application platform and doing something fun.

## TODO List

[ ] Add NPC characters that just amble about
[X] Add an attack action
[ ] Attacks should kill NPC
[ ] Loot items
[.] HUD
[ ] Transfer player between maps
[ ] Maps should share tiles
[X] Events should trigger animations

## Development

The one thing you should never attempt is to write an MMORPG.

However if you want to give it a go, you can run:

```shell
$ yarn
# In ./client
$ yarn start
# In ./server
$ yarn dev
```
